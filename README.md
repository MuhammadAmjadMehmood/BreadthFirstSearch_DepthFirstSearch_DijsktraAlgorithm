Overview
This Python script demonstrates graph traversal algorithms - Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), along with Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph. It utilizes Python's defaultdict and heapq modules for efficient graph representation and priority queue operations.

Features
DFS (Depth-First Search): Traverses the graph depth-wise, visiting vertices recursively.
BFS (Breadth-First Search): Traverses the graph level-wise, visiting vertices in breadth-first order.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.
